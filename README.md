# GitHub Finder

This is a code along Brad Traversy's React Front To Back course. The first project serves as an introduction to React, and is built using Functional Components, Hooks and Context API.

It fetches data from the GitHub API to create a very simple and clean interface to find users and explore their repositories.

Build with React.js and Bulma CSS.
